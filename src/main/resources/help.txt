1. Players have money and can own properties. Each player starts with HKD 1500 and no property.

2. All players start from the first square ('Go').

3. Players take turns in rolling the dice and advancing their respective tokens clockwise on the board.
   After reaching square 20, a token moves to square 1 again.

4. Certain squares take effect on a player (see below) when her token passes or lands on the square. For
   example, they can change the playerâ€™s amount of money.

5. If after taking a turn a player has a negative amount of money, she retires from the game. All her
   properties become unowned.

                                         --Income tax--

If a player lands on this square,she pays 10% of her money (rounded down to a multiple of 10) as tax.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                         --Free parking--

This square has no effect.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          --Go to Jail--

If landing on this square, she immediately goes to the 'In Jail' part of the 'In Jail/Just Visiting' square.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                          --In Jail/Just Visiting--

If a player lands on this square, she is 'Just Visiting': the square has no effect.
If the player got here by landing on 'Go to Jail', she is in jail and cannot make a move.

>>>>Tip 1:
A player gets out of jail by either throwing doubles (i.e., both dice coming out the same face up) on any
of her next three turns (if she succeeds in doing this, she immediately moves forward by the number of spaces
shown by her double throw) or paying a fine of HKD 150 before she rolls the dice on either of her next two turns.

>>>>Tip 2:
If the player does not throw doubles by her third turn, she must pay the HKD 150 fine. She then gets out of jail
and immediately moves forward the number of spaces shown by her throw.

* In Jail: 3-- in Jail, the 1st turn
           2-- in Jail, the 2nd turn
           1-- in Jail, the 3rd turn
           0-- RELEASE from jail/ JUST VISITING
